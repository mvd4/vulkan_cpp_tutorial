# Welcome to the Vulkan C++ Tutorial
### Getting started with Vulkan using the C++ wrapper

This is the code repository for my Vulkan C++ tutorial. You can find it at http://vulkan-cpp-tutorial.mvd-hq.de/

In this tutorial series I want to create a simple 3D graphics application using the official C++ Wrapper for the cross-platform Vulkan Graphics SDK. I’ll cover the basics of compute and rendering pipelines and techniques like texture-mapping, anti-aliasing, lighting etc. Advanced topics such as performance optimization or raytracing will not be in the scope of this tutorial. So while I’ll try to explain the API and the underlying functionality as good as I can, this is not intended to be an exhaustive reference and you will not become a Vulkan expert just by following along here. However, I hope this will turn out to be a good starting point on your journey into the world of graphics programming with Vulkan.

Every lesson will get a dedicated branch in this repository to help you follow along. 

Have fun!

### System Requirements
* Windows, macOS or Linux
* C++ 17 compiler toolchain
* [CMake](https://cmake.org)
* [Conan](https://conan.io/)

For a more detailed setup guide, please refer to lesson #1.

### Disclaimers:
1. I’m not an expert in graphics programming. I’m writing this tutorial in the spirit of learning-by-teaching in the hope that it’ll be of help to others and ease their first steps in becoming Vulkan experts. If you spot errors or inaccuracies, please let me know so I can fix them and make this knowledge available to everyone.
2. I’m standing on the shoulders of giants here. A lot of what I know about Vulkan programming I learned from the fantastic vulkan tutorial. I also got quite a bit out of looking at the vookoo library. So please check out these great projects and consider supporting the authors.
